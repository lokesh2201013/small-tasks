# Here are three common security risks in DevOps workflows:

### Hardcoded Secrets and  Mismanaged Credentials

Storing API keys, passwords, or tokens in source code, environment variables, or configuration files can expose them to unauthorized access.


### Unverified Dependencies & Vulnerabilities

Using third-party libraries or Docker images without vulnerability scanning can introduce security flaws.


### Insufficient Access Controls & Privilege Escalation

Overly permissive IAM roles, shared credentials, or lack of least privilege enforcement can lead to unauthorized access.

### Unencrypted Data in Transit & at Rest

Storing or transmitting sensitive data without encryption increases the risk of data breaches.

## What are ISO 27001, GDPR, or SOC 2

### ISO 27001 (Information Security Management System - ISMS)
What it is:
 An international standard for managing information security.

#### Purpose: 
Helps organizations establish a structured Information Security Management System (ISMS) to protect sensitive data.

#### Key Principles:
Risk management and security controls

Regular security assessments

Access control and data encryption

#### Who needs it?
 Organizations handling sensitive information, such as financial institutions, cloud providers, and IT companies.

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation - EU Law)

#### What it is: 
A legal framework that protects the personal data of individuals in the European Union (EU).

#### Purpose: 
Ensures data privacy, security, and gives individuals control over their personal data.

#### Key Principles:
Data minimization and purpose limitation

User consent and the right to be forgotten

Strong encryption and breach notification requirements

#### Who needs it? 
Any company that collects, stores, or processes EU citizens' data, even if they are outside the EU.

### SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2 - US Compliance Standard)

#### What it is:
 A compliance framework for assessing security, availability, and privacy of data in cloud-based services.

#### Purpose:

 Ensures that service providers handle customer data securely.

#### Key Trust Principles:
Security (protection from unauthorized access)
Availability (systems remain operational)
Confidentiality (data is protected from exposure)

#### Who needs it? 
Cloud service providers (AWS, Azure, SaaS platforms) and companies handling customer data.

## Mitigation strategies for above security risks

### Hardcoded Secrets & Mismanaged Credentials
 Risk:
 
Storing API keys, passwords, or tokens in source code, environment variables, or config files can lead to unauthorized access.

### Mitigation Strategies (Compliance Alignment):

#### ISO 27001 (A.9.2, A.12.1): 
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and enforce the principle of least privilege (PoLP) to protect sensitive credentials.

#### GDPR (Article 32 – Security of Processing): 
Use encryption and access controls to secure personal data from unauthorized access.

#### SOC 2 (Security & Confidentiality Criteria):
 Implement a centralized secret management system like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Azure Key Vault to control and rotate secrets securely.

### Unverified Dependencies & Vulnerabilities

#### Risk: Using unscanned third-party libraries or Docker images can introduce security flaws.

#### Mitigation Strategies (Compliance Alignment):

#### ISO 27001 (A.12.6.1 – Vulnerability Management): 
Regularly scan dependencies and container images for vulnerabilities using Trivy, Snyk, or SonarQube.
#### GDPR (Article 25 – Data Protection by Design & Default):
 Ensure secure development practices by validating third-party libraries before use.
#### SOC 2 (Change Management & Risk Assessment):
 Implement automated vulnerability scanning and Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track all dependencies.

### Insufficient Access Controls & Privilege Escalation

Risk: Overly permissive IAM roles, shared credentials, or lack of least privilege enforcement can lead to unauthorized access.

#### Mitigation Strategies (Compliance Alignment):

#### ISO 27001 (A.9 – Access Control):

Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and just-in-time (JIT) access for privileged accounts.
#### GDPR (Article 32 – Access Restriction): 

Restrict access to personal data based on the need-to-know principle.

#### SOC 2 (Security & Access Control):
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with AWS IAM, Azure AD, or Kubernetes RBAC.

### Unencrypted Data in Transit & at Rest
 Risk: Storing or transmitting sensitive data without encryption increases the risk of data breaches.

#### Mitigation Strategies (Compliance Alignment):

#### ISO 27001 (A.10 – Cryptographic Controls):
 
Enforce encryption of sensitive data using AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.

#### GDPR (Article 32 – Encryption & Pseudonymization):

Implement data masking, anonymization, or tokenization for storing 
personally identifiable information (PII).

#### SOC 2 (Confidentiality & Security): 

Apply end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for sensitive data processing and ensure encryption key management using AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, or GCP KMS.
