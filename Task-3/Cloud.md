#  Cloud Security Best Practices

## 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
✅ Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP): Grant minimal necessary permissions.

✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Use roles, not individual permissions.

✅ Enable MFA: Add a second layer of security.

✅ Use Temporary Credentials: Prefer short-lived tokens over static ones.

## 2. Data Security

✅ Encryption at Rest & In Transit: Use AES-256 and TLS 1.2+.

✅ Key Management Services (KMS): Manage encryption keys securely.

✅ Regular Data Backups: Automate backups with redundancy.

✅ Storage Access Controls: Limit access to sensitive data.

## 3. Network Security

✅ Firewalls & Security Groups: Restrict traffic to only necessary 
sources.

✅ Private Networking: Use private IPs where possible.

✅ Zero Trust: Always verify identity and enforce access control.

✅ DDoS Protection: Use native DDoS mitigation tools.

✅ VPNs & Private Endpoints: Secure connections with minimal exposure.

## 4. Monitoring & Logging

✅ Enable Logging & Auditing: Use CloudTrail, Cloud Logging, etc.

✅ Intrusion Detection: Use security tools for real-time threat detection.

✅ Centralized Log Storage: Aggregate logs in a SIEM solution.

✅ Real-Time Alerts: Automate responses to security events.

## 5. Secure SDLC

✅ Secure CI/CD Pipelines: Use tools for scanning vulnerabilities.

✅ IaC Security: Implement scanning for Terraform/CloudFormation.

✅ Patch Management: Keep software and dependencies updated.


## 6. Incident Response & Disaster Recovery
✅ Incident Response Plan: Define workflows for security events.

✅ Automate Threat Remediation: Use automated playbooks.

✅ Multi-Region Failover: Ensure resilience against failures.

✅ Regular Security Drills: Test incident response readiness.
